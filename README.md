# Injaaz App

This repository is the new, production-ready rewrite of the Injaaz site-visit application.

Quickstart (local)
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values (do not commit secrets).
2. Start local services (recommended with Docker Desktop + Compose) or deploy to Render later.
3. Run the app via Docker Compose or manage.py (we provide instructions after scaffold PR).

Notes
- Keep secrets out of the repo (use Render env vars or local `.env` not tracked).
- After you push the scaffold branch, open a Pull Request and share the link for review.
